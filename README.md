# Converter for Nominal Attributes
The aim is to convert the nominal attributes to numeric by using Twoing and Gini algorithms.
### Task
Dummy attribute technique has a problem like causing the big size of the dataset. Therefore, regression trees can use to convert the nominal attributes to numeric without any size problem. Twoing and Gini algorithms as regression trees find a numeric gain value for each nominal cell value. In this assignment, you will convert all attributes to numeric values using Twoing and Gini algorithms separately.

•	The file format of the dataset must be ARFF (of WEKA tool). 

•	iris.arff is an example file. You must browse the file from the window of your application like the following figure;

•	Some attributes can be already numeric. These attributes won't be changed, but for using Twoing and Gini, the dataset must be discretize firstly.
